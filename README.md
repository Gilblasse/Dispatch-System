# Dispatch System

This is a mock React + TypeScript application for managing trip dispatches. It uses Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first UI.

## Structure
- **src/types** – shared TypeScript interfaces
- **src/data** – hardcoded mock data
- **src/components** – React components
- **src/styles** – Tailwind CSS setup

All data is kept in local state and there is no backend.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This runs a Vite powered React + TypeScript app at `http://localhost:3000`.
