# Dispatch System

This is a mock React + TypeScript application for managing trip dispatches. It uses Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first UI.

## Structure
- **src/types** – shared TypeScript interfaces
- **src/data** – hardcoded mock data
- **src/components** – React components
- **src/styles** – Tailwind CSS setup

All data is kept in local state and there is no backend.
